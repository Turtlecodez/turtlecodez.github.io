                <p style="display: inline; float: right; font-size: 18px; transform: translate(-20px, 10px);">My first look into programming was in 3rd grade, with the program <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. I used that program all the way up until 5th grade, where I bought a Raspberry Pi 4, which is a small computer. Through the Pi 4 I learned the basics of the coding language Python, and how to make some pretty cool things with it. I've been using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript since before 6th grade started. You can see my first foray into text languages <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Turtle_codez/sketches/ao8Qng9Q5">here</a>. This project was created over 3 years ago, and while school was happening I took my first real foray into the world of web design, learning the very basics of HTML and CSS. The year after, I learned the workings of GitHub and Vercel, as well as how to host websites. The summer after, I took the Harvard online course known with the alias CS50W, a course on programming for the web. This helped me vastly increase my programming knowledge and become much better at HTML and CSS, boosting me from making basic 2000s style websites to making websites that can hold up to modern standards.</p>
